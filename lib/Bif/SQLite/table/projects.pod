=head1 DESCRIPTION

Table C<projects> contains the project-specific meta data for a topic.
Rows should only be inserted into this table by
L<func_new_project()|Bif::SQLite::func_new_project> and only updated by
triggers on the L<project_mergers|Bif::SQLite::table::project_mergers>
table. Deleting directly from this table is fine.
