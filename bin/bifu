bifu - run bif commands in your user repository

0.1.4 (2014-10-27)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  bifu COMMAND [...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<bifu> is a version of L<bif> that runs commands against your user
repository instead of the current local repository. It is basically an
alias for C<bif --user-repo>.

This is convenient for using bifu as a personal addressbook program, or
for managing personal projects that you want to access regardless of
which current directory your shell is in.
